#Example 1
Suppose Cindy wants to accumulate 750000 dollars over the next 40 years.  She decides to use an investment tool that will allow her to make monthly payments.  The investment tool pays 8.2% interest and compounds monthly.  How much should Cindy's regular monthly payments be in order to reach her goal?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $A = 750000$  - Investment goal.
*  $n = 12$ - Regular payments are made monthly.
*  $t = 40$ - The example states the investment period will be 40 years.
*  $r = 0.082$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$P = \frac{  A \left( \frac{r}{n}\right) }{ \left( \left( 1+ \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} -1 \right)  } = \frac{  750000 \left( \frac{0.082}{12}\right) }{ \left( \left( 1+ \frac{0.082}{12} \right)^{12 \cdot 40} -1 \right)  } \approx 202.72$$

Cindy only needs to invest 202.72 dollars every month for the next 40 years in order to reach her goal of 7500000.

#Example 2
Suppose Sam decides he only needs 250000 dollars in retirement.  He will retire in 20 years.  He plans on using an investment tool that will allow him to make weekly payments.  The investment tool pays 6.4% interest compounded weekly.  How much should Sam's weekly payments into the investment be in order to reach his goal?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $A = 250000$  - Investment goal.
*  $n = 52$ - Regular payments are made weekly.
*  $t = 20$ - The example states the investment period will be 20 years.
*  $r = 0.064$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$P = \frac{  A \left( \frac{r}{n}\right) }{ \left( \left( 1+ \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} -1 \right)  } = \frac{  250000 \left( \frac{0.064}{52}\right) }{ \left( \left( 1+ \frac{0.064}{52} \right)^{52 \cdot 20} -1 \right)  } \approx 118.63$$

Sam will need to make weekly payments of 118.63 dollars in order to reach his goal of 250000 dollars in 20 years using his investment strategy.
