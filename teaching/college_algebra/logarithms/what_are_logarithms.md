#Introduction To Logarithms

The best way to understand logarithms is probably to jump right into an example. Consider the following equation below.
$$5^2 = 25$$
Logarithms provide an alternate way to represent exponential equations.  Look at the equation below.
$$\log_5(25) = 2$$
The above equation can be read as "log base 5 of 25 is 2".  Logarithms essentially answer the question "What power of 5 will result in the number 2?".

To provide another example, consider the equation below.
$$2^x = 64$$
In this example the exponent is not known.  Perhaps we would like to solve this equation. Traditional algebraic steps do not allow us to isolate the $x$ variable on one side of the equal sign. In this case, we could use some trial and error to figure out that $x=6$.
$$2^6 = 64$$
In this case, the logarithmic version of the equation could be expressed below.
$$x = \log_2(64) = 6$$

#Exact and Approximate Values
The expression $\log_2(64)$ represents an exact value.  However, it is not simplified because the value is equivalent to the number $6$.  Not all logarithms can be simplified further.  Consider the example below.
$$5^x = 7$$
There is no straight forward way to calculate the value of $x$.  In fact, the value of $x$ is an irrational number. This means the digits of $x$ (after the decimal) will continue forever never forming a repeating pattern.  However, we can express the exact value of $x$ using logarithms.  This is demonstrated below.
$$x = \log_5(7)$$
The exact value of $x$ can be represented as $\log_5(7)$.  This logarithmic expression can not be simplified further.  If necessary, we can get the approximate value using a calculator. This is shown below.
$$\underbrace{\log_5(7)}_{\text{Exact}} \approx \underbrace{1.20906195...}_{\text{Approximate}}$$
Mathematicians often prefer to use exact values when possible.  They permit values to be used in other calculations without any loss of precision.  Each time an approximate value is passed from one process to the next some precision is lost.
