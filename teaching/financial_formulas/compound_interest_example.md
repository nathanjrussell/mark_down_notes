#Example 1
Suppose Cindy inherits $15000 from her uncle's estate. She decides to investment the money in an investment tool that pays 5.8% interest compounded monthly. How much will the investment be worth at the end of 34 years?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $P = 15000$  - This is the initial investment as a single lump sum of money.
*  $n = 12$ - Notice the example states that interest will be compounded monthly.
*  $t = 34$ - The example states the investment period will be 34 years.
*  $r = 0.058$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$A = P \left( 1 + \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} = 15000 \left( 1 + \frac{0.058}{12} \right)^{12 \cdot 34} \approx 107264.72$$

The investment will be worth $107264.72 after earning interest for 34 years.

#Example 2
Suppose Sam wins a contest with a cash prize of $7000 . He decides to investment the money in an investment tool that pays 6% interest compounded quaterly. How much will the investment be worth at the end of 24 years?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $P = 7000$  - This is the initial investment as a single lump sum of money.
*  $n = 4$ - Notice the example states that interest will be compounded quarterly.
*  $t = 24$ - The example states the investment period will be 24 years.
*  $r = 0.06$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$A = P \left( 1 + \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} = 7000 \left( 1 + \frac{0.06}{4} \right)^{4 \cdot 24} \approx 29230.62$$

The investment will be worth $29230.62 after earning interest for 24 years.
