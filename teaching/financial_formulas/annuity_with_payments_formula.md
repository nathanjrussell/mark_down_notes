#Example 1
Suppose Cindy wants to make regular monthly payments (end of month) of 325 dollars into an investment tool.  The investment tool pays 6.9% interest and compounds at the end of each month.  How much will this investment strategy be worth at the end of 35 years?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $P = 325$  - Regular monthly payments
*  $n = 12$ - Regular payments are made monthly.
*  $t = 35$ - The example states the investment period will be 35 years.
*  $r = 0.069$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$A =  \frac{P \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} -1 \right)}{\left( \frac{r}{n} \right)}  = \frac{325 \left( \left(1+\frac{0.069}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 35} -1 \right)}{\left( \frac{0.069}{12} \right)} \approx 571584.11$$

This investment strategy will be worth approximately 571584.11 dollars at the end of 35 years.  That is over half a million dollars!!!  Notice that if Cindy only saved the payments, without investing, the value would only be 136500 dollars.

#Example 2

Suppose Sam wants to retire in 25 years.  He decides to contribute 50 dollars a week into an investment tool that pays 7.7% interest and compounds weekly.  How much will his retirement account be worth when he retires?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $P = 50$  - Regular monthly payments
*  $n = 52$ - Regular payments are made weekly.
*  $t = 25$ - The example states the investment period will be 35 years.
*  $r = 0.077$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$A =  \frac{P \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} -1 \right)}{\left( \frac{r}{n} \right)}  = \frac{50 \left( \left(1+\frac{0.077}{52}\right)^{52 \cdot 25} -1 \right)}{\left( \frac{0.077}{52} \right)} \approx 197376$$

Sam's retirement account will be worth 197376.97 dollars when he retires in 25 years.
Notice if he simply saved 50 dollars a week, without investing, that would only accumulate to 65000 dollars.
