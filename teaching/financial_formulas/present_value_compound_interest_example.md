#Example 1
Suppose Cindy wants to start an investment to accumulate 80000 dollars in 37 years.  She decides to use an investment tool that will earn 7.1% interest and compounds weekly.   How much does Cindy need to invest in order to reach her goal of $80000 using this investment tool.

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $A = 80000$  - This is the goal of the investment.
*  $n = 52$ - Notice the example states that interest will be compounded weekly.
*  $t = 37$ - The example states the investment period will be 37 years.
*  $r = 0.071$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$P = \frac{A}{ \left( 1+ \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}} = \frac{80000}{ \left( 1+ \frac{0.071}{52} \right)^{52 \cdot 37}} \approx  5793.97$$

Cindy will need to invest $5793.97 now in order for her investment to grow to 80000 dollars over the next 37 years.

#Example 2
Suppose Sam wants to start college fund for his son.  Sam hopes the college fund will grow to  50000 dollars in 18 years.  Sam decides to use an investment tool that will earn 8.3% interest and compounds semi-annually.   How much does Sam need to invest now in order for the college fund to grow to 50000 dollars over the next 18 years?

##Solution

Here are the values that will used in the formula

*  $A = 50000$  - This is the goal of the investment.
*  $n = 2$ - Notice the example states that interest will be compounded semiannually.
*  $t = 18$ - The example states the investment period will be 18 years.
*  $r = 0.083$ - The interest rate is quoted as a percentage but will be used as a decimal value in the formula (shift decimal two places to the left).

The value of the investment strategy after 34 years is given below
$$P = \frac{A}{ \left( 1+ \frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}} = \frac{50000}{ \left( 1+ \frac{0.083}{2} \right)^{2 \cdot 18}} \approx  11567.41$$

Sam will need to invest $11567.41 now in order for the college fund to grow to 50000 dollars over the next 18 years.
